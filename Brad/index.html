        <h4>Descriptor:</h4>
        Widdle Wocket Employee 28 <br>
        <h4>Quote:</h4>
        “Our main focus is to make science fun for kids.”<br/>
        “Advanced physics is easier to understand when you have a solid foundation in math and science.”<br/><br>

        <h4>Who is it:</h4>
        Brad is a 28 year old Widdle Wocket employee. He works at our headquarters in Detroit, MI. He is a determined developer/Widdle Wocket enthusiast. He is charge of selling the idea of Widdle Wockets to investors. <br><br>

        <h4>What Goals:</h4>
        Brad’s supreme motivator currently is building relavant skills for his professional career. Another goal he has is to teach the younger generation about how fun STEM can be. He wants to be challenged at work and also allow people to have fulfilling experiences.<br><br>

        <h4>What attitude:</h4>
        Brad has a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. He expects a lot from the team and from the product. His motivation to visit the website is development.<br><br>

        <h4>Which Behavior:</h4>
        He is very adamant about the design of the product, and is constantly looking through the website and lessons taking notes on things he sees that he would like to adjust. One thing that frustrates him is how the website deals with connection issues.<br><br>

        Brad’s improvement mindset is very import to pay attention to. There are already developer tools in browsers to help make apps better, but including some more on our side to help our developers would be important to know in the development process.<br><br>

        Brad cares about the company and therefore cares deeply about functional, emotional, and expressive benefits. He wants the product to be the best possible, and he believes those are important aspects that need to be considered during development.<br><br>

        Brad is a very fast decision maker. He doesn’t like wasting time on figuring out if something is wrong, he’d rather clean up the mistake later. This is evident in his coding styles. He codes very quickly and when he’s finished with a thought, he’ll go back and fix his mistakes.<br><br>

        Brad makes his decisions based on facts. In order to make quick decisions, he relies on what he knows and not what he feels. This is evident through his coding styles and the way he audits the website.<br>
