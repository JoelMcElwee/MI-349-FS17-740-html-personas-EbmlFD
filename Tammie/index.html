      <h2>Tammie Franzen</h2>
      <p>

        <h4>Descriptor:</h4>
        Female Corporate executive Age 46 <br>

        <h4>Quote:</h4>
        “The future of our society is in the hands of the youth.”<br>
        “Technology is the only way we’ll make it to the future.”<br><br>

        <h4>Who is it:</h4>
        Tammie is a 46 year old CEO of a tech company. She works in Silicone Valley. Tammie is a very approachable woman who is very interested in investing in the youth. She has started and is involved with multiple initiatives to teach young children about technology. <br><br>

        <h4>What Goals:</h4>
        Tammie’s motivation is seeing kids grow and learn. She also desires for lower income communities to get the same attention. She wants to empower children of all walks of life and all levels of income.<br><br>

        <h4>What attitude:</h4>
        Tammie used to be a developer, so she can’t help but to be very critical of any product she sees. She is the leader of a very successful web development company, so she expects great products. She really likes the website and wants to aide in its further development. She really likes the goal we have and that’s what keeps drawing her to our website.<br><br>

        <h4>Which Behavior:</h4>
        When she hears about the website, she looks it up and is very impressed with the design and functionality. She visits the site on all of her devices just to make sure it looks good on everything and that we are legit. She also goes through some of the lessons to observe what kids would see on the website.<br><br>

        The most important mind style for Tammie would be her determination to see if we are a legitimate entity. She checks out our motivations, and makes sure our development is sound so that she can be certain of her decision to work with us.<br><br>

        Tammie takes the websites functional, emotional, and expressive benefits very seriously. She doesn’t want to invest in something kids don’t even like.<br><br>

        Tammie is a medium decision maker. She makes very quick initial determinations, but “checks her work” so it can seem like it takes a long time for her to make decisions.<br><br>

        Tammie absolutely bases her decisions on facts. She actively tries to avoid making decisions on emotions. This is apparent because of the time it takes for her to make decisions.<br>
