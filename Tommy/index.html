      <h2>Tommy Black</h2>
      <p>

        <h4>Descriptor:</h4>
        Male Child age 4 <br>
        <h4>Quote:</h4>
        “I want to be an astronaut when I grow up!”<br/>
        “I use mommy’s iPad to watch PAW patrol”<br/><br>

        <h4>Who is it:</h4>
        Tommy is a 4 year old who is still in preschool. He lives in Waco, Texas and loves animals and planets! He is a very outgoing 4 year old but understands that he needs to follow directions some times. <br><br>

        <h4>What Goals:</h4>
        Tommy’s infatuated with becoming an astronaut. He is really excited whenever anyone asks him about it!<br><br>

        <h4>What attitude:</h4>
        Tommy plays on his mother’s iPad all the time, so he expects anything else to function the same way. He get’s very frustrated when things don’t work. He’s really excited to be a little rocket though, so he’s always asking his mom to go to the website. The games and interactivity are what he likes the most.<br><br>

        <h4>Which Behavior:</h4>
        When Tommy gets on the website, he gets super focused and begins playing games immediately. He usually tires himself out after about 25 minutes. He then starts watching Netflix or goes to play somewhere else. He eventually returns to the device and opens the website again. Whenever there is a snag in the connection, Tommy will bring the iPad back to his mother and tell her that it’s broken. He usually won’t wait for her to fix it, but comes back for it about 30 minutes later.<br><br>

        The attention span trend is very important for this persona. The website needs to be very engaging in order to keep the attention of its audience.<br><br>

        Functional, emotional and expressive benefits are paramount to this individual, though he is a young child. If these don’t deliver then the experience won’t be enjoyable for him. What’s more important is that Tommy most likely will not be able to articulate an issue in this area, so the development team will need to be proactive.<br><br>

        Tommy is a very fast decision maker. He is constantly jumping around from activity to activity. He decides very quickly if he likes something or not, and will not give any further attention to something if it does not pique his interest.<br><br>

        Tommy’s decisions are solely based on emotion. We can tell because of how quickly he makes his decisions. He’s also not old enough yet to really contemplate decisions, so he defaults to emotion rather than searching for facts.<br>
